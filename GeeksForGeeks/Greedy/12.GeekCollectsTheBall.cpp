// Geek Collects the ball

// Question:
// There are two parallel roads, each containing N and M buckets, respectively. Each bucket may contain some balls. 
// The buckets on both roads are kept in such a way that they are sorted according to the number of balls in them. 
// Geek starts from the end of the road which has the bucket with a lower number of balls(i.e. if buckets are 
// sorted in increasing order, then geek will start from the left side of the road).
// The geek can change the road only at the point of intersection(which means, buckets with the same number of 
// balls on two roads). Now you need to help Geek to collect the maximum number of balls.

// Input:
// The first line of input contains T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers N and M, denoting the number of buckets on road1 and road2 respectively. 2nd line of each test case contains N integers, number of balls in buckets on the first road. 3rd line of each test case contains M integers, number of balls in buckets on the second road.

// Output:
// For each test case output a single line containing the maximum possible balls that Geek can collect.

// Example:
// Input:
// 1
// 5 5
// 1 4 5 6 8
// 2 3 4 6 9

// Output:
// 29
